  From the first moment I began working as a lead software architect at Signals Network, I was extremely excited about the software we had planned to build â€” an online platform, where users can program and run their trading strategies using just their browsers. At the same time, I knew I would have to deal with quite specific requirements for a component,
  which would be responsible for the execution of user-coded strategies. </p>
<p>
  The component had to meet the following criteria:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Automated strategy deployment</b><br>
      Execution of a strategy coded in the web editor must be a fully automated process, without any manual steps or configurations.
    </li>
  </ul>
